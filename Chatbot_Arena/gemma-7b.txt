```neo4j
MATCH (e)<-[:USES]-(f) WHERE f IS (Cause_motion) RETURN e
```

**2. Inter-element Relationship:**

```neo4j
MATCH (a)<-[:HAS_SUBFRAME]-(f) WHERE f IS (Cause_motion) RETURN a
```

**3. Frame Relations and Hierarchies:**

```neo4j
MATCH (f)<-[:INHERITS_FROM]-(g) WHERE f IS (Cause_motion) RETURN g
```

**4. Metaphorical and Contrastive Relationships:**

```neo4j
MATCH (f)<-[:IS_USED_BY]-(m) WHERE f IS (Cause_motion) AND m IS (Metaphor) RETURN m
```

**5. Precedes and Is Causative of Relationships:**

```neo4j
MATCH (a)<-[:PRECEDES]-(b) WHERE a IS (Cause_motion) RETURN b
```

**6. Frame Subframe Relationships:**

```neo4j
MATCH (f)<-[:HAS_SUBFRAME]-(g) WHERE f IS (Cause_motion) AND g IS (Placing) RETURN g
```

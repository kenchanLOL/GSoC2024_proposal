### Frame and Element Node Creation
Thought: To build the knowledge graph, we need to create nodes for the frame "Cause_Motion" and each of its elements (FEs). These nodes will serve as the basic units in the graph that can be interconnected through various relationships.

Action:
```cypher
CREATE (:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Agent", type: "Core"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Theme", type: "Core"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Source", type: "Core"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Path", type: "Core"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Goal", type: "Core"})
CREATE (:Element {name: "Result", type: "Core"})
// ... Create other elements similarly
```

### Link Element to Frame
Thought: Each element should be linked to the "Cause_Motion" frame to show that it is a part of this frame. This can be achieved using relationships in the graph.

Action:
```cypher
MATCH (f:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"}), (e:Element {name: "Agent"})
CREATE (e)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f)

MATCH (f:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"}), (e:Element {name: "Theme"})
CREATE (e)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(f)

// ... Repeat for other elements
```

### Inter-element Relationship
Thought: Some elements have exclusive or related roles within the frame, indicating a more complex internal structure that can be represented through relationships.

Action:
```cypher
MATCH (e1:Element {name: "Source"}), (e2:Element {name: "Path"})
CREATE (e1)-[:LEADS_TO]->(e2)

MATCH (e1:Element {name: "Path"}), (e2:Element {name: "Goal"})
CREATE (e1)-[:ENDS_IN]->(e2)

// ... Define other relevant inter-element relationships
```

### Frame Relations and Hierarchies
Thought: Frames can have hierarchical and relational links, such as inheritance or usage relationships. These should be represented to understand the frame structure and its connections to other frames.

Action:
```cypher
CREATE (:Frame {name: "Transitive_action"})
MATCH (f1:Frame {name: "Transitive_action"}), (f2:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"})
CREATE (f2)-[:INHERITS_FROM]->(f1)

// ... Define other frame relations similarly
```

### Metaphorical and Contrastive Relationships
Thought: Metaphorical uses of the frame and its contrastive relationships with other frames provide deeper semantic insights, which should be represented in the graph.

Action:
```cypher
MATCH (f1:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"}), (f2:Frame {name: "Placing"})
CREATE (f1)-[:CONTRASTS_WITH]->(f2)

// Assuming metaphorical relationships are defined as nodes
CREATE (:Metaphor {name: "Catapulted to stardom"})
MATCH (f:Frame {name: "Cause_Motion"}), (m:Metaphor {name: "Catapulted to stardom"})
CREATE (f)-[:USED_IN_METAPHOR]->(m)

// ... Repeat for other metaphorical and contrastive relationships
```

This set of graph queries establishes the nodes and relationships necessary to build a detailed knowledge graph representing the "Cause_Motion" frame, its elements, and its various relationships and hierarchies.

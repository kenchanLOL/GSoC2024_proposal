# Knowledge Graph-Augmented RAG Systems for Improved Frame Blending Generation

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance frame blending generation using knowledge graph-augmented RAG systems. The main goals include:

1. **Constructing a comprehensive FrameNet knowledge graph** to capture complex relationships such as inter-element relationships and frame hierarchies.

2. **Developing a frame blending system with KG-enhanced RAG**, improving the system's explainability and controllability, and reducing hallucinations.

3. **Developing a chatbot application for frame blending** (conditional), allowing interactive generation or refinement of frame blending outcomes.

## Technology Focus
- **FrameNet:** A semantic database essential for mapping meanings in the knowledge graph.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Key to processing FrameNet data and constructing knowledge graphs.

## Plan and Timeline
- Start with enhancing understanding of KG-enhanced RAG and FrameNet.
- Develop a KG Constructor to convert XML data into a Knowledge Graph.
- Build the LLM Frame Blending system using a self-collaboration model approach.
- Implement a Gradio application for visualization and interaction.
- Conclude with testing, documentation, and reporting.
